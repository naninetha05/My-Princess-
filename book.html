            "It’s amazing to think that just a few months ago, we were simply friends.
            When we first started talking, I never expected that our bond would grow this strong.
            Even though we haven’t met in person yet, every call and every message has made me feel closer to you.
            From the moment we expressed our feelings for each other, everything changed,
            and I couldn’t be more grateful to have you in my life. 😌🫂"
